# Ikea_Dashboard

An ikea consumer dataset was used for this dashboard. The main aim of this project was to find key variables that impact and boost profitability. the following variable were included in the dataset:

1.Order date and quantity. 2.Customer Name. 3.Segment. 4.Product category. 5.Sales. 6.Profit. 7.Discount. 8.Shipping mode.

Tableau was used to analyse the data and these are the key findings:

Consumer items account for over half of total sales volume relative to home office and co-operate items. Phones are the top selling products accounting for 4.9k in sales while fastners were the least selling products. Discount and order quantity have a positve relationship while profits and discounts have an overall negative relationship.

what was interesting to see is that though more discounts increased customer order quantity, it affected profits negatiively! so how can we make discounts more profitable? the answer and key recomeedation can be found in the line graph, a closer observation shows that profit spirals downward from 2014-2015 but when discount drops from 7.27% to 2.10% in 2016, we see an immediate rise in profits from -17745.54 to -1019.46 and a decline in 2017 when discount rate increases to 4%, indicating that discounts could impact profits postively if set at an optimal level. for this Ikea store the optimal level is between 2%-3.5%
